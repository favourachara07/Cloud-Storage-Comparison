This document summarizes the key differences between **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, **Amazon S3 (AWS)**, and **Azure Blob Storage**, highlighting their features, advantages, and ideal use cases.

## Key Comparisons
| Feature              | Amazon S3 (AWS)             | Google Cloud Storage (GCS) | Azure Blob Storage       |
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Storage Classes**  | Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, One Zone-IA, Glacier | Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive | Hot, Cool, Archive |
| **Durability**       | 99.999999999% (11 9â€™s)     | 99.999999999% (11 9â€™s)    | 99.999999999% (11 9â€™s)  |
| **Availability**     | 99.99% (Standard), 99.95% (IA), 99.9% (Glacier) | 99.99% (Multi-region), 99.95% (Regional) | 99.99% (Hot), 99.9% (Cool), 99% (Archive) |
| **Pricing Model**    | Pay-per-use, tiered storage | Pay-per-use, auto-tiering | Pay-per-use, tiered storage |
| **Security**         | IAM, bucket policies, encryption (AES-256, SSE-KMS) | IAM, bucket policies, encryption (AES-256, CMEK) | IAM, RBAC, encryption (Azure Key Vault) |
| **Performance**      | Strong consistency, optimized for cloud-native apps | Nearline/coldline optimizations, fast retrieval | Hybrid integration, optimized for Microsoft ecosystem |
| **Best For**        | Enterprises, content delivery, analytics | AI/ML, streaming, hybrid cloud | Microsoft ecosystem, enterprise IT, backup & recovery |

## Major Differences
1. **Amazon S3** is the most widely used cloud storage solution, offering strong scalability and reliability. It's a great choice for enterprises and applications that require large-scale storage solutions, such as **big data analytics, content distribution, and backups**.
2. **Google Cloud Storage** is best for AI/ML workloads, **real-time data processing**, and applications requiring **low-latency retrieval**. Itâ€™s a strong option for companies leveraging **Googleâ€™s ecosystem**.
3. **Azure Blob Storage** integrates deeply with Microsoft services, making it ideal for **hybrid cloud deployments** and businesses already using Azure services. It is commonly used for **backup, disaster recovery, and enterprise file storage**.

## Real-World Applications
### **Amazon S3**
- Hosting static websites and web applications.
- Storing and processing large datasets for machine learning models.
- Content delivery for streaming platforms.

### **Google Cloud Storage**
- Real-time analytics and AI-driven data processing.
- Media streaming platforms requiring **low-latency access**.
- Backup solutions with intelligent storage class tiering.

### **Azure Blob Storage**
